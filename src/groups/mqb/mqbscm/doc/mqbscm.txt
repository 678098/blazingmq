@PURPOSE: Provide versioning information for 'mqb' library components.

@MNEMONIC: BlazingMQ Source Control Management (mqbscm)

@DESCRIPTION: This package provides versioning information that is incorporated
 into every release of the 'mqb' Package Group Library.  This versioning
 information is in turn available to all clients of 'mqb' both at run time and
 by inspection of appropriate .o files.  Note that, except for the package
 name, this version functionality is repeated in every package group within the
 MQB library.  This document therefore serves as documentation for all 'XXXscm'
 packages within the MQB library.
